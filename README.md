# The Box Game

This is a simple game I played growing up. I wanted to learn more about React's useReducer hook, and thus this project was born.

## Rules

The game should be played with two people. Your goal is to create a box by clicking on the dotted lines while preventing your opponent from creating boxes. The player with the most completed boxed once all squares are filled is the winner.
